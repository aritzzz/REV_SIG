They propose directly optimizing the time-dependent discrimination index using a siamese survival network. Experiments on several real-world dataset reveal modest gains in comparison with the state of the art.\\\\n\\\\n- The authors should clearly highlight what is their main technical contribution. For example, Eqs. 1-6 appear to be background material since the time-dependent discrimination index is taken from the literature, as the authors point out earlier. However, this is unclear from the writing. \\\\n\\\\n- One of the main motivations of the authors is to propose a model that is specially design to avoid the nonidentifiability issue in an scenario with competing risks. It is unclear why the authors solution is able to solve such an issue, specially given the modest reported gains in comparison with several competitive baselines. In other words, the authors oversell their own work, specially in comparison with the state of the art.\\\\n\\\\n- The authors use off-the-shelf siamese networks for their settting and thus it is questionable there is any novelty there. The application/setting may be novel, but not the architecture of choice.\\\\n\\\\n- From Eq. 4 to Eq. 5, the authors argue that the denominator does not depend on the model parameters and can be ignored. However, afterwards the objective does combine time-dependent discrimination indices of several competing risks, with different denominator values. This could be problematic if the risks are unbalanced.\\\\n\\\\n- The competitive gain of the authors method in comparison with other competing methods is minor.\\\\n\\\\n- The authors introduce F(t, D | x) as cumulative incidence function (CDF) at the beginning of section 2, however, afterwards they use R^m(t, x), which they define as risk of the subject experiencing event m before t. Is the latter a proxy for the former? How are they related?\"', 'VARIANCE': 0, 'CONFIDENCE': '4', 'SCORES': [6.888857143, 85.23873991148139, -0.7810731530189514]}\n"

The implementation of this seems straightforward, and can be done either via initialization or via pruning on the off-diagonals. There are a few ideas the paper discusses:\\\\n\\\\n(1) compared to pruning weight matrices and making them sparse, block diagonal matrices are more efficient since they utilize level 3 BLAS rather than sparse operations which have significant overhead and are not \\\\\"worth it\\\\\" until the matrix is extremely sparse. I think this case is well supported via their experiments, and I largely agree.\\\\n\\\\n(2) that therefore, block diagonal layers lead to more efficient networks. This point is murkier, because the paper doesn\\'t discuss possible increases in *training time* (due to increased number of iterations) in much detail. At if we only care about running the net, then reducing the time from 0.4s to 0.2s doesn\\'t seem to be that useful (maybe it is for real-time predictions? Please cite some work in that case)\\\\n\\\\n(3) to summarize points (1) and (2), block diagonal architectures are a nice alternative to pruned architectures, with similar accuracy, and more benefit to speed (mainly speed at run-time, or speed of a single iteration, not necessarily speed to train)\\\\n\\\\n[as I am not primarly a neural net researcher, I had always thought pruning was done to decrease over-fitting, not to increase computation speed, so this was a surprise to me; also note that the sparse matrix format can increase runtime if implemented as a sparse object, as demonstrated in this paper, but one could always pretend it is sparse, so you never ought to be slower with a sparse matrix]\\\\n\\\\n(4) there is some vague connection to random matrices, with some limited experiments that are consistent with this observation but far from establish it, and without any theoretical analysis (Martingale or Markov chain theory)\\\\n\\\\nThis is an experimental/methods paper that proposes a new algorithm, explained only in general details, and backs up it up with two reasonable experiments (that do a good job of convincing me of point (1) above). The authors seem to restrict themselves to convolutional networks in the first paragraph (and experiments) but don\\'t discuss the implications or reasons of this assumption. The authors seem to understand the literature well, and not being an expert myself, I have the impression they are doing a fair job.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe paper could have gone farther experimentally (or theoretically) in my opinion. For example, with sparse and block diagonal matrices, reducing the size of the matrix to fit into the cache on the GPU must obviously make a difference, but this did not seem to be investigated. I was also wondering about when 2 or more layers are block sparse, do these blocks overlap? i.e., are they randomly permuted between layers so that the blocks mix? And even with a single block, does it matter what permutation you use? (or perhaps does it not matter due to the convolutional structure?)\\\\n\\\\nThe section on the variance of the weights is rather unclear mathematically, starting with the abstract and even continuing into the paper. We are talking about sample variance? What does DeltaVar mean in eq (2)? The Marchenko-Pastur theorem seemed to even be imprecise, since if y>1, then a < 0, implying that there is a nonzero chance that the positive semi-definite matrix XX\\' has a negative eigenvalue.\\\\n\\\\nI agree this relationship with random matrices could be interesting, but it seems too vague right now. Is there some central limit theorem explanation? Are you sure that you\\'ve run enough iterations to fully converge? (Fig 4 was still trending up for b1=64). Was it due to the convolutional net structure (you could test this)? Or, perhaps train a network on two datasets, one which is not learnable (iid random labels), and one which is very easily learnable (e.g., linearly separable). Would this affect the distributions?\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, I think I misunderstood parts, because the scaling in MNIST and CIFAR was different and I didn\\'t see why (for MNIST, it was proportional to block size, and for CIFAR it was independent of block size almost).\\\\n\\\\nMinor comment: last paragraph of 4.1, comparing with Sindhwani et al., was confusing to me. Why was this mentioned? And it doesn\\'t seem to be comparable.

They find many properties reminiscent of neurons in the mammalian entorhinal cortex (EC): grid cells, border cells, etc. When regularization of the network is not used during training, the trained RNNs no longer resemble the EC. This suggests that those constraints (lower overall connectivity strengths, and lower metabolic costs) might play a role in the EC\\'s navigation function. \\\\n\\\\nThe paper is overall quite interesting and the study is pretty thorough: no major cons come to mind. Some suggestions / criticisms are given below.\\\\n\\\\n1) The findings seem conceptually similar to the older sparse coding ideas from the visual cortex. That connection might be worth discussing because removing the regularizing (i.e., metabolic cost) constraint from your RNNS makes them learn representations that differ from the ones seen in EC. The sparse coding models see something similar: without sparsity constraints, the image representations do not resemble those seen in V1, but with sparsity, the learned representations match V1 quite well. That the same observation is made in such disparate brain areas (V1, EC) suggests that sparsity / efficiency might be quite universal constraints on the neural code.\\\\n\\\\n2) The finding that regularizing the RNN makes it more closely match the neural code is also foreshadowed somewhat by the 2015 Nature Neuro paper by Susillo et al. That could be worthy of some (brief) discussion.\\\\n\\\\nSussillo, D., Churchland, M. M., Kaufman, M. T., & Shenoy, K. V. (2015). A neural network that finds a naturalistic solution for the production of muscle activity. Nature neuroscience, 18(7), 1025-1033.\\\\n\\\\n3) Why the different initializations for the recurrent weights for the hexagonal vs other environments? I\\'m guessing it\\'s because the RNNs don\\'t \\\\\"work\\\\\" in all environments with the same initialization (i.e., they either don\\'t look like EC, or they don\\'t obtain small errors in the navigation task). That seems important to explain more thoroughly than is done in the current text.\\\\n\\\\n4) What happens with ongoing training? Animals presumably continue to learn throughout their lives. With on-going (continous) training, do the RNN neurons\\' spatial tuning remain stable, or do they continue to \\\\\"drift\\\\\" (so that border cells turn into grid cells turn into irregular cells, or some such)? That result could make some predictions for experiment, that would be testable with chronic methods (like Ca2+ imaging) that can record from the same neurons over multiple experimental sessions.\\\\n\\\\n5) It would be nice to more quantitatively map out the relation between speed tuning, direction tuning, and spatial tuning (illustrated in Fig. 3). Specifically, I would quantify the cells\\' direction tuning using the circular variance methods that people use for studying retinal direction selective neurons. And I would quantify speed tuning via something like the slope of the firing rate vs speed curves. And quantify spatial tuning somehow (a natural method would be to use the sparsity measures sometimes applied to neural data to quantify how selective the spatial profile is to one or a few specific locations). Then make scatter plots of these quantities against each other. Basically, I\\'d love to see the trends for how these types of tuning relate to each other over the whole populations: those trends could then be tested against experimental data (possibly in a future study).\"', 'VARIANCE': 0, 'CONFIDENCE': '4', 'SCORES': [15.37752101, 75.84131736526946, -0.3662371505861697], 'PREDICTIONS': {'layer1': (4.050241947174072, 5.15281343460083), 'layer2': (5.1738176345825195, 3.6826324462890625), 'layer3': (3.599306583404541, 3.8519327640533447)}, 'NORMALISED': array([ 5.15281365,  3.68263239, -0.36623715])}\n",

They show that their analytical solution implements a form of BFS algorithm, characterize the probability of introducing \\\\\"bugs\\\\\" in the algorithm as the weights move away from the optimal solution, and how this influences the error surface for different depths. This analysis is conducted by drawing on results from the field of critical percolation in physics.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, I think this is a good paper and its core contribution is definitely valuable: it provides a novel analysis of an algorithmic task which sheds light on how and when the network fails to learn the algorithm, and in particular the role which initialization plays. The analysis is very thorough and the methods described may find use in analyzing other tasks. In particular, this could be a first step towards better understanding the optimization landscape of memory-augmented neural networks (Memory Networks, Neural Turing Machines, etc) which try to learn reasoning tasks or algorithms. It is well-known that these are sensitive to initialization and often require running the optimizer with multiple random seeds and picking the best one. This work actually explains the role of initialization for learning BFS and how certain types of initialization lead to poor solutions. I am curious if a similar analysis could be applied to methods evaluated on the bAbI question-answering tasks (which can be represented as graphs, like the maze task) and possibly yield better initialization or optimization schemes that would remove the need for multiple random seeds.  \\\\n\\\\nWith that being said, there is some work that needs to be done to make the paper clearer. In particular, many parts are quite technical and may not be accessible to a broader machine learning audience. It would be good if the authors spent more time developing intuition (through visualization for example) and move some of the more technical proofs to the appendix. Specifically:\\\\n- I think Figure 3 in the appendix should be moved to the main text, to help understand the behavior of the analytical solution. \\\\n- Top of page 5, when you describe the checkerboard BFS: please include a visualization somewhere, it could be in the Appendix.\\\\n- Section 6: there is lots of math here, but the main results don\\'t obviously stand out. I would suggest highlighting equations 2 and 4 in some way (for example, proposition/lemma + proof), so that the casual reader can quickly see what the main results are. Interested readers can then work through the math if they want to. Also, some plots/visualizations of the loss surface given in Equations 4 and 5 would be very helpful. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, although I found their work to be interesting after finishing the paper, I was initially confused by how the authors frame their work and where the paper was heading. They claim their contribution is in the analysis of loss surfaces (true) and neural nets applied to graph-structured inputs. This second part was confusing - although the maze can be viewed as a graph, many other works apply ConvNets to maze environments [1, 2, 3], and their work has little relation to other work on graph CNNs. Here the assumptions of locality and stationarity underlying CNNs are sensible and I don\\'t think the first paragraph in Section 3 justifying the use of the CNN on the maze environment is necessary. However, I think it would make much more sense to mention how their work relates to other neural network architectures which learn algorithms (such as the Neural Turing Machine and variants) or reasoning tasks more generally (for example, memory-augmented networks applied to the bAbI tasks). \\\\n\\\\nThere are lots of small typos, please fix them.

I think such generalization is interesting but the innovation seems to be very limited. \\\\n\\\\nThe paper develops three different kinds of solvers for TR decomposition, i.e., SVD, ALS and SGD. All of these are well known methods. \\\\n\\\\nFinally, the paper provides experimental results on synthetic data (3 oscillated functions) and image data (few sampled images).

And those \\\\\"theorems\\\\\" in section 4 are just some properties from previous definitions; they are not theorems. \\\\n2. The property of TR decomposition is that the tensors can be shifted (circular invariance). This is an interesting property and it seems to be the major strength of TR over TT. I think the paper could be significantly improved by providing more applications of this property in both theory and experiments.\\\\n3. As the number of latent tensors increase, the ALS method becomes much worse approximation of the original optimization. Any insights or results on the optimization performance vs. the number of latent tensors?\\\\n4. Also, the paper mentions Eq. 5 (ALS) is optimized by solving d subproblems alternatively. I think this only contains a single round of optimization. Should ALS be applied repeated (each round solves d problems) until convergence?\\\\n5. What is the memory consumption for different solvers?\\\\n6. SGD also needs to update at least d times for all d latent tensors. Why is the complexity O(r^3) independent of the parameter d?\\\\n7. The ALS is so slow (if looking at the results in section 5.1), which becomes not practical.

      "{'RECOMMENDATION': '7', 'REVIEW TITLE': ' ', 'comments': '\"Summary:\\\\n The paper presents an unsupervised method for detecting adversarial examples of neural networks. The method includes two independent components: an \\\\u2018input defender\\\\u2019 which tried to inspect the input, and a \\\\u2018latent defender\\\\u2019 trying to inspect a hidden representation. Both are based on the claim that adversarial examples lie outside a certain sub-space occupied by the natural image examples, and modeling this sub-space hence enables their detection. The input defender is based on sparse coding, and the latent defender on modeling the latent activity as a mixture of Gaussians. Experiments are presented on MInst, Cifar10, and ImageNet.\\\\n \\\\n-\\\\tIntroduction: The motivation for detecting adversarial examples is not stated clearly enough. How can such examples be used by a malicious agent to cause damage to a system? Sketching some such scenarios would help the reader understand why the issue is practically important. I was not convinced it is. \\\\nPage 4: \\\\n-\\\\tStep 3 of the algorithm is not clear:\\\\no\\\\tHow exactly does HDDA model the data (formally) and how does it estimate the parameters? In the current version, the paper does not explain the HDDA formalism and learning algorithm, which is a main building block in the proposed system (as it provides the density score used for adversarial examples detection). Hence the paper cannot be read as a standalone document. I went on to read the relevant HDDA paper, but it is also not clear which of the model variants presented there is used in this paper.\\\\no\\\\tWhat is the relation between the model learned at stage 2 (the centers c^i) and the model learnt by HDDA? Are they completely different models? Or are the C^I used when learning the HDDA model (and how)? \\\\nIf these are separate models, how are they used in conjunction to give a final density score? If I understand correctly, only the HDDA model is used to get the final score, and the C^i are only used to make the \\\\\\\\phy(x) representation more class-seperable. Is that right?\\\\n-\\\\tFigure 4, b and c: it is not clear what the (x,y,z) measurements plotted in these 3D drawings are (what are the axis).\\\\nPage 5:\\\\n-\\\\tSection 2: the risk analysis is done in a standard Bayesian way and leads to a ratio of PDFs in equation 5. However, this form is not appropriate for the case presented at this paper, since the method presented only models one of these PDFs (Specifically p(x | W1)  - there is not generative model of p(x|W2)).  \\\\n-\\\\tThe authors claim in the last sentence of the section that p(x|W2) is equivalent to 1-p(x|W1), but this is not true: these are two continuous densities, they do not sum to 1, and a model of p(x|W2) is not available (as far as I understand the method)\\\\nPage 6:\\\\n-\\\\tHow is equation 7) optimized?\\\\n-\\\\tWhich patchs are extracted from images, for training and at inference time? Are these patchs a dense coverage of the image? Sparsely sampled? Densely sampled with overlaps?\\\\n-\\\\tIts not clear enough what exactly is the \\\\u2018PSNR\\\\u2019 value which is used for the adversarial example detection, and what exactly is \\\\u2018profile the PSNR of legitimate samples within each class\\\\u2019. A formal definition of PSNR and\\\\u2019profiling\\\\u2019 is missing (does profiling simply mean finding a threshold for filtering?)\\\\nPage 7:\\\\n-\\\\tFigure 7 is not very informative. Given the ROC curves in figure 8  and table 1 it is redundant. \\\\n\\\\nPage 8:\\\\n-\\\\tThe results in general indicate that the method is much better than chance, but it is not clear if it is practical, because the false alarm rates for high detection are quite high. For example on ImageNet, 14.2% of the innocent images are mistakenly rejected as malicious to get 90% detection rate. I do not think this working point is useful for a real application\\\\n-\\\\tGiven the high flares alarm rate, it is surprising that experiments with multiple checkpoints are not presented (specifically as this case of multiple checkpoints is discussed explicitly in previous sections of the paper).  Experiments with multiple checkpoints are clear required to complete the picture regarding the empirical performance of this method\\\\n-\\\\tThe experiments show that essentially, the latent defenders are stronger than the input defender in most cases. However, an ablation study of the latent defender is missing: Specifcially, it is not clear a) how much does stage 2 (model refinement with clusters)  contribute to the accuracy (how does the model do without it? And 3) how important is the HDDA and the specific variant used (which is not clear) important: is it important to model the Gaussians using a sub-space? Of which dimension?\\\\n\\\\nOverall:\\\\nPros:\\\\n-\\\\t A nice idea with some novelty,  based on a non-trivial observation\\\\n-\\\\tThe experimental results how the idea holds some promise\\\\nCons\\\\n-\\\\tThe method is not presented clearly enough: the main component modeling the network activity is not explained (the HDDA module used)\\\\n-\\\\tThe results presented show that the method is probably not suitable for a practical application yet (high false alarm rate for good detection rate)\\\\n-\\\\tExperimental results are partial: results are not presented for multiple defenders, no ablation experiments\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAfter revision:\\\\nSome of my comments were addressed, and some were not.\\\\nSpecifically, results were presented for multiple defenders and some ablation experiments were highlihgted\\\\nThings not addressed:\\\\n - The risk analysis is still not relevant. The authors removed a clearly flawed sentence, but the analysis still assumes that two densities (of \\'good\\' and \\'bad\\' examples) are modeled, while in the work presented only one of them is. Hence this analysis does not add anything to the paper-  it states a general case which does not fit the current scenario and its relation to the work is not clear.
