{"rating": "7", "confidence": "4", "review": "\"I only got access to the paper after the review deadline; and did not have a chance to read it until now. Hence the lateness and brevity.\\n\\nThe paper tackles an important theoretical question; and it offers results that are complementary to existing results (e.g., Soudry et al). However, the paper does not properly relate their results, assumptions in the context of the existing literature. Much explanation is needed in the author reply in order to clear these questions.\\n\\nThe work should not be evaluated from a practical perspective as it is of a theoretical nature.\\n\\nI agree with most of the criticism raised by other reviewers. However, I also believe the authors managed to clear essentially of the criticism in they reply. The paper lacks in clarity as currently written. \\n\\nThe results are interesting, but more explanation is needed for the main message to be conveyed more clearly. I suggest 7, but the paper has a potential to become 8 in my eyes in a future resubmission.\\n\"", "variance": 0, "title": " "}
