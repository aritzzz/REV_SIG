 "I only got access to the paper after the review deadline; and did not have a chance to read it until now. Hence the lateness and brevity.[[EXT-NEG], [null]] \n\nThe paper tackles an important theoretical question; and it offers results that are complementary to existing results (e.g., Soudry et al). [[INT-POS], [EMP-POS]] However, the paper does not properly relate their results, assumptions in the context of the existing literature.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Much explanation is needed in the author reply in order to clear these questions.[[OAL-NEU], [null]] \n\nThe work should not be evaluated from a practical perspective as it is of a theoretical nature.[[OAL-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nI agree with most of the criticism raised by other reviewers[[EXT-NEG], [null]] . However, I also believe the authors managed to clear essentially of the criticism in they reply.[[EXT-POS], [null]]  The paper lacks in clarity as currently written.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG]]  \n\nThe results are interesting, but more explanation is needed for the main message to be conveyed more clearly.[[RES-POS], [CLA-NEU]]  I suggest 7, but the paper has a potential to become 8 in my eyes in a future resubmission.\n"[[OAL-NEU], [null]]
