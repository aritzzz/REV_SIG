 "I only got access to the paper after the review deadline; and did not have a chance to read it until now. Hence the lateness and brevity.[[DIS], [GEN]] \n\nThe paper tackles an important theoretical question; and it offers results that are complementary to existing results (e.g., Soudry et al). [[SMY], [MAJ]] However, the paper does not properly relate their results, assumptions in the context of the existing literature.[[DFT], [MAJ]]  Much explanation is needed in the author reply in order to clear these questions.[[QSN], [MIN]] \n\nThe work should not be evaluated from a practical perspective as it is of a theoretical nature.[[DIS], [GEN]] \n\nI agree with most of the criticism raised by other reviewers[[CRT], [MAJ]] . However, I also believe the authors managed to clear essentially of the criticism in they reply.[[FBK], [MAJ]]  The paper lacks in clarity as currently written.[[DFT], [MAJ]]  \n\nThe results are interesting, but more explanation is needed for the main message to be conveyed more clearly.[[SUG,APC], [MIN]]  I suggest 7, but the paper has a potential to become 8 in my eyes in a future resubmission.\n"[[FBK], [MAJ]]
