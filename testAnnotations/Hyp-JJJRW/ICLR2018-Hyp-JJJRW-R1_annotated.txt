 "This paper proposes to train a classifier neural network not just to classifier, but also to reconstruct a representation of its input, in order to factorize the class information from the appearance (or \"style\" as used in this paper).[[SMY], [GEN]]  This is done by first using unsupervised pretraining and then fine-tuning using a weighted combination of the regular multinomial NLL loss and a reconstruction loss at the last hidden layer.[[SMY], [GEN]]  Experiments on MNIST are provided to analyse what this approach learns.[[SMY], [GEN]] \n\nUnfortunately, I fail to see a significantly valuable contribution from this work.[[CRT], [MAJ]]  First, the paper could do a better job at motivating the problem being addressed[[SUG], [MAJ]] . Why is it important to separate class from style?[[QSN], [MIN]]  Should it allow better classification performance?[[QSN], [MIN]]  If so, it's never measured in this work.[[CRT], [MAJ]]  If that's not the motivation, then what is it?[[QSN], [MIN]] \n\nSecond, all experiments were conducted on the MNIST dataset.[[SMY], [MIN]]  In 2017, most would expect experiments on at least one other, more complex dataset, to trust any claims on a method.[[DIS], [MIN]] \n\nFinally, the results are not particularly impressive.[[CRT], [MAJ]]  I don't find the reconstructions demonstrated particularly compelling (they are generally pretty different from the original input).[[CRT], [MAJ]]  Also, that the \"style\" representation contain less (and I'd say slightly less, in Figure 7 b and d, we still see a lot of same class nearest neighbors) is not exactly a surprising result.[[CRT], [MAJ]]  And the results of figure 9, showing poor reconstructions when changing the class representation essentially demonstrates that the method isn't able to factorize class and style successfully.[[CRT], [MAJ]]  The interpolation results of Figure 11 are also underwhelming, though possibly mostly because the reconstructions are in general not great.[[CRT], [MAJ]]  But most importantly, none of these results are measured in a quantitative way: they are all qualitative, and thus subjective.[[DFT,CRT], [MAJ]] \n\nFor all these reasons, I'm afraid I must recommend this paper be rejected."[[FBK], [MAJ]]
