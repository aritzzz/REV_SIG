 "Congratulations on a very interesting and clear paper.[[APC], [MAJ]]   While ICLR is not focused on neuroscientific studies, this paper clearly belongs here as it shows what representations develop in recurrent networks that are trained on spatial navigation.[[APC], [MAJ]]  Interestingly, these include representations that have been observed in mammals and that have attracted considerable attention, even honored with a Nobel prize. [[APC], [MAJ]] \n\nI found it is very interesting that the emergence of these representations was contingent on some regularization constraint.[[APC], [MAJ]]  This seems similar to the visual domain where edge detectors emerge easily when trained on natural images with sparseness constraints as in Olshausen&Field and later reproduced with many other models that incorporate sparseness constraints.[[APC], [MAJ]]  \n\nI do have some questions about the training itself.[[DIS], [MIN]]  The paper mentions a metabolic cost that is not specified in the paper.[[DFT], [MIN]]  This should be added.[[SUG], [MIN]]  \n\nMy biggest concern is about Figure 6a.[[CRT], [MIN]]  I am puzzled why is the error is coming down before the boundary interaction?[[QSN], [MIN]]  Even more puzzling, why does this error go up again for the blue curve (no interaction)? Shouldn\u2019t at least this curve be smooth?\n"[[QSN], [MIN]]
